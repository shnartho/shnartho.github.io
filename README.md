## How to view my websites  
Ans: Here I have multiple websites with multiple pages. Therefore, to view any website first check the folder name. Then add index.html. For example, you want to view test5 website live then use the url like below, 
<br>
  <b> shnartho.github.io/test5/index.html </b> <br>
   To view test6 website live then use the url like below, <br>
  <b> shnartho.github.io/test6/index.html </b><br>
   
   
## Repository 
check folders, files and codes <br>
<b> https://github.com/shnartho/shnartho.github.io </b>
   
   ++ so basically you have to add folder name and index file with the url shnartho.github.io
